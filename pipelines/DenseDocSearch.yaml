# If you need help with the YAML format, have a look at https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai/docs/create-a-pipeline#create-a-pipeline-using-yaml.
# This is a friendly editor that helps you create your pipelines with autosuggestions. To use them, press control + space on your keyboard.
# Whenever you need to specify a model, this editor helps you out as well. Just type your Hugging Face organization and a forward slash (/) to see available models.

# This is a default document search pipeline with a good embedding-based Retriever
version: '1.10.0'
name: 'DenseDocSearch'

# This section defines nodes that you want to use in your pipelines. Each node must have a name and a type. You can also set the node's parameters here.
# The name is up to you, you can give your component a friendly name. You then use components' names when specifying their order in the pipeline.
# Type is the class name of the component. 
components:
  - name: DocumentStore
    type: DeepsetCloudDocumentStore # The only supported document store in deepset Cloud
  - name: Retriever # Selects the most relevant documents from the document store
    type: EmbeddingRetriever # Uses one Transformer model to encode the document and the query
    params:
      document_store: DocumentStore
      embedding_model: sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 # Model optimized for semantic search
      model_format: sentence_transformers 
      top_k: 20 # The number of results to return
  - name: FileTypeClassifier # Routes files based on their extension to appropriate converters
    type: FileTypeClassifier
  - name: TextConverter # Converts .txt files into documents
    type: TextConverter
  - name: PDFConverter # Converts PDFs into documents
    type: PDFToTextConverter
  - name: Preprocessor # Splits documents into smaller ones and cleans them up
    type: PreProcessor
    params:
      # With a dense retriever, it's good to split your documents into smaller ones
      split_by: word # The unit by which you want to split the documents
      split_length: 250 # The max number of words in a document
      split_overlap: 30 # Enables the sliding window approach
      split_respect_sentence_boundary: True # Retains complete sentences in split documents
      language: en # Used by NLTK to best detect the sentence boundaries for that language

# Here you define how the nodes are organized in the pipelines
# For each node, specify its input
