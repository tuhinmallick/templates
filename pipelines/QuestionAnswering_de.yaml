# This is a friendly editor that helps you create your pipelines with autosuggestions. To use them, press Control + Space on your keyboard.
# Whenever you need to specify a model, this editor helps you out as well. Just type your Hugging Face organization and a forward slash (/) to see available models.

# This is a baseline Question Answering pipeline for German. It uses a vector-based search and a German QA model.
version: 1.12.2
name: 'QuestionAnswering_de'

# This section defines nodes that you want to use in your pipelines. Each node must have a name and a type. You can also set the node's parameters here.
# The name is up to you, you can give your component a friendly name. You then use components' names when specifying their order in the pipeline.
# Type is the class name of the component. 
components:
  - name: DocumentStore
    type: DeepsetCloudDocumentStore # The only supported document store in deepset Cloud
    params:
      similarity: cosine # Recommended for sentence transformer models
  - name: Retriever # Selects the most relevant documents from the document store and then passes them on to the Reader
    type: EmbeddingRetriever # Uses a Transformer model to encode the document and the query
    params:
      document_store: DocumentStore
      embedding_model: sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-multilingual-en-de-v2-tmp-lng-aligned
      model_format: sentence_transformers
      top_k: 20 # The number of results to return
  # A "Reader" model that goes through those 20 candidate documents and identifies the exact answer
  - name: Reader # The component that actually fetches answers from the 20 documents returned by retriever    
    type: FARMReader # Transformer-based reader, specializes in extractive QA
    params:
      model_name_or_path: deepset/gelectra-large-germanquad
      context_window_size: 700 # The size of the window around the answer span
  - name: FileTypeClassifier # Routes files based on their extension to appropriate converters, by default txt, pdf, md, docx, html
    type: FileTypeClassifier
  - name: TextConverter # Converts files into documents
    type: TextConverter
  - name: PDFConverter # Converts PDFs into documents
    type: PDFToTextConverter
  - name: Preprocessor # Splits files into smaller documents and cleans them up
    type: PreProcessor
    params:
      # With a vector-based (dense) retriever, it's good to split your files into smaller documents
      split_by: word # The unit by which you want to split the documents
      split_length: 250 # The max number of words in a document
      split_overlap: 30 # Enables the sliding window approach
      split_respect_sentence_boundary: True # Retains complete sentences in split documents
      language: de # Used by NLTK to best detect the sentence boundaries for that language

# Here you define how the nodes are organized in the pipelines
# For each node, specify its input
